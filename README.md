# LinReg
This is my own implementation of the Linear Regression exercise from the Coursera Machine Learning course by Stanford.

This project requires numpy and matplotlib. 

ex1.py contains the data preprocessing and plotting. myMLlib.py contains implementations of the cost function and gradient descent.
